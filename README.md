# Reading Beautiful C++

Notes and material related to reading the book Beautiful C++.

## Resources

The book Beautiful C++ can be purchased in various formats from different vendors. I went for a e-book version from [informIT - Beautiful C++](https://www.informit.com/store/beautiful-c-plus-plus-30-core-guidelines-for-writing-9780137647842) due to that it comes in a pdf version here. Having a pdf version mens that you are not locked in having to read the book in a certain proprietary e-book reader.

The content presented in the book is related to the [C++ Core Guidelines](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines). The book Beautiful C++ can be read first to get an introduction to the guidelines that then can studied further at this link.

For ease of experimentation, all sample code is available on [Compiler Explorer](https://godbolt.org/z/cg30-ch0.0).
