## Related Resources

The book Beautiful C++ can be purchased in various formats from different vendors. I went for a e-book version from [informIT - Beautiful C++](https://www.informit.com/store/beautiful-c-plus-plus-30-core-guidelines-for-writing-9780137647842) due to that it comes in a pdf version here. Having a pdf version mens that you are not locked in having to read the book in a certain proprietary e-book reader.
